# Candidates Rejecting Unemployment Duty (CRUD)

This SPA is an offshoot of a [repo](https://github.com/Paulo-Pinto/GetRandomUser) I did a while back, that used jQuery to make calls to the [randomuser API](https://randomuser.me/) and Bootstrap to style how the information was displayed.

I added CRUD funcionality with a "hiring" narrative, all the while learning a lot about developing with "The Progressive Javascript Framework" [Vuejs](vuejs.org) with [Vite](vite.config.js).
